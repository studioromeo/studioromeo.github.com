I hope this doesn't come across the wrong way, honestly I really don't expect anything. But I also know how hard it can be to buy things for people **when you want to** so I wanted to write something to take the guesswork out.

But what I still love the most is spending time with you!

Here are some things we could do together

- A bike ride
- Go for a meal / watch a film
- Explore a new place together
- Shopping
- Bowling / Arcades
- Etc

I'll leave this list up, if you want to buy something then honestly, you're too generous.

Seriously thank you! 🥰

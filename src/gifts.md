I hope this doesn't come across the wrong way, honestly I really don't expect anything. But I also know how hard it can be to buy things for people **when you want to** so I kinda wanted to supply something that makes that somewhat easier? I don't know.

I'll leave this list up, if you want to buy something then honestly, you're wonderful and I don't deserve you, but seriously thank you! ðŸ¥°

title: Congestion Busting with Blackfire.io
---

Recently at work I was involved a project which aimed to improve the performance of one of our analytics systems. We needed a way of measuring our progress of certain user flows before and after optimization so we could give the client feedback on how the project was progressing.

[Blackfire](https://blackfire.io/) is a performance measuring tool written by the folks behind the symfony php framework and was ideal for the task. You can read about my experience with blackfire over on the [Box UK dev blog](https://boxuk.com/insight/tech-posts/reducing-congestion-with-blackfire-io).

Earlier this evening Pippin, author of Easy Digital Downloads tweeted about [an idea](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/support/topic/send-a-copy-of-the-receipt-to-another-address/) for a simple little plugin to extend EDD's customer receipts, sending blind copies to email addresses specified in the admin.

Interested to have a go I opened up my code editor and got cracking. After a while I had myself a working plugin which is now [available on github](https://github.com/studioromeo/edd-bcc)!

Cheers guys!

TODO: read management book

### First Day

- Walk through high level stuff
- Avoid ice breakers. Instead opt for self sustaining yet inclusive chit chat (eg existing team mates chat to each other but prompt newcomers for input)
  - Creates a warm atmosphere
  - Doesn't put the new person on the spot
  - Gives them a feel for the teams personailities without intense 1 on 1
  - Humanises the team, especially if they are remote
- Remember their name !!! and key info about them
- Show excitement for them being on the team
  - make them feel valued from day 1

### Second Day

- Check that they have everything they need [121]
- Project setup (if not done on first day)
- Ask them if theres anything that didn't make sense yesterday (good to do this regularly)
- Ask them how they'd like to receive feedback

### Rest of week

- Get them setup (walk them through what they need to do and leave them to it, but be around and approachable)
- Get them making something as soon as possible (ideally completing in their first few days)
  - start with clear well defined unambiguous work. Easier to explain while you're still working out how each other communicate

#### General tips

- Impart knowledge just in time. Tell them what to do when they need it vs brain dumping
  - Let them have input, ask them how they'd approach it
- Try to not drop them in the deep end
  - Have awareness of where they are at and what tasks are out of their reach right now.
  - Everyone has a slow initial period of figuring stuff out, then they start to get the hang of things before settling into the tricky research again
- Pre-empt awkwardness. Reach out often and early so they feel comfortable talking to you.
  - but don't micromanage
  - don't only ask open questions like "hows it going?" because the response can be "yea fine" and you are no wiser. Instead ask leading questions like "how did you solve X?". Can you walk me through the code?. What are your plans for Y?. 
- Keep discussions friendly & light hearted. Look for common ground within reason.
- Be patient. everything is a learning process and they will take longer than you expect. Common feeling is "this person is slow", but are they or are you holding them to unreasonable expectations?
- Celebrate their wins
  - They'll be anxious to impress, celebrate what they do well
  - When they achieve something celebrate it, don't go over the top keep it genuine, a simple :raised_hands: goes a long way

- Make notes
  - Newcomers will highlight difficulties. much can be learned by the team
    - Eg was there some code they struggled with? Why was that? Could it be improved?

- Provide a cheatsheet
  - Events and ceremonies
  - Useful links
  - Key people and their roles
  - glossary of unusual terms

First post
Before they join
- Walk through the newbie checklist
- Organise their week (charting, todo list)
- Talk through the plan with everyone involved

Second post

Their first day
- Start with a casual meet the team chit chat (no ice breakers)
- Explain the week
- Walk through the thing, talk about the good parts, save the bad parts
- Let them get orientated

Third post
First week
- Give an acheivable goal (no knowledge required yet feels like a valid contribution)
-


Key points I want to get across

- (1) Before they join
    - Make sure they have everything they need before they start
        - Use a newbie checklist
    - Plan out their week in a spreadsheet so you can visualise how their week is shaping up
        - Start with soft team + high level overview stuff like what will happen on their first week
    - Have clear & concise setup readme
    - Walk through the plan with the rest of the team

- (2) Their first day
    - Walk through high level stuff
    - Avoid ice breakers. Instead opt for self sustaining yet inclusive chit chat (eg existing team mates chat to each other but prompt newcomers for input)

- (3) Following days
    - Get them setup (walk them through what they need to do and leave them to it, but be around and approachable)
    - Get them making something as soon as possible (ideally completing in their first few days)
        - start with clear well defined unambiguous work. Easier to explain while you're still working out how each other communicate

- General tips
    - Impart knowledge just in time. Tell them what to do when they need it vs brain dumping
    - Pre-empt awkwardness. Reach out often and early so they feel comfortable talking to you.
        - but don't micromanage
    - Keep discussions friendly & light hearted. Look for common ground.
    - Be patient. everything is a learning process and they will take longer than you expect

- Make notes
    - Newcomers will highlight difficulties. much can be learned by the team

- Provide a cheatsheet
    - Events and ceremonies
    - Useful links
    - Key people and their roles
    - glossary of unusual terms

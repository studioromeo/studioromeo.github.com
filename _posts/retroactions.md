Thoughts:

- Actions don't seem to be kept up long term, why?
- Some keep a swimlane but what happens when those actions are "done"? 
  - Who keeps on track?
  - Why do they keep track?
- What is the goal of a retro?
  - Decide how to work with each other best?
  - Anything else agenda? (missing tasks etc)
  - Letting off steam?
- Retros seem to form two types of action
  - Singular tasks to do
  - Recurring tasks / Ideologies
- Actions are asked to be SMART
  - Specific
  - Measurable
  - Actionable
  - Realistic
  - Time based
  - --- but this only ensures that the outcome is good. How we get there is ???
- Benefits aren't checked up on in the future (how do we know if it's still working for us)
- Too many actions..how many is too many?
- How do we measure how effective our actions are? Review in next retro?
- Are all actions valued euqlally



James clears Atomic habits mixes with this

- Cue, Craving, Response, Reward
- Cues can be time based or habit stacking (eg after an existing habit do X)
- Habit scorecard (check up on existing habits)



Example: Our project is using out of date dependencies, we need to update them

Typical action: Update dependencies

Issue: Action is completed. But it will reoccur because nothing is setup to protect this

Improved action: Decide to adopt the habit of checking for dependencies after standup.

Cue, Standup

Craving: Dependencies need updating

Response: Updating dependencies

Reward: Nothing more to update

<p>This took me an age to prepare, probably the hardest 3 minutes of my life but here it goes. The transcript is below incase anyone wants to read through.</p>
<p>Hi Guys, I'm Rob.</p>
<p>I'm a PHP Developer working at BoxUK, Cardiff.
I've been working in PHP for the best part of 3 years and I'm a fond fan of the <a href="http://laravel.com/">Laravel</a> framework, and also a proud early subscriber of <a href="http://laracasts.com">Laracasts</a>.</p>
<p>So why am I here?</p>
<p>I'm hoping to do a series of screencasts to document my progress building <a href="http://anchorcms.com">Anchor CMS</a> in Laravel.</p>
<p>Now Laravel is a framework for web artisans. It's super flexible and just great fun to work in (at least that's my opinion).</p>
<p>Anchor CMS on the other hand is a really light weight CMS built in nano. It's probably comparable to something like ghost where the content is written in Markdown and then it is processed and output to a screen.</p>
<p>The difference is this is written in PHP and contains a bit more functionality to do with pages and that whole side of things.</p>
<p>The problem with it though is it's not really, well to be fair it was created at a time when PHP unit tests and testing in general wasn't mainstream, not many people were talking about it. </p>
<p>In addition to that composer hadn't really been created yet so it hadn't been packaged up / dependency managed.</p>
<p>So the problems with it are that it's not tested and nor is it very easy to update or extend. </p>
<p>So what am I hoping to achieve by doing these screencasts?</p>
<p>The first and the main goal for me is to improve my confidence and presentation skills. Hopefully by doing these I will be able to have the confidence to move out and start doing talks around Cardiff and elsewhere on various topics.</p>
<p>Another thing I hope to do is learn more about Laravel and how it works.</p>
<p>And finally for you guys hopefully give you inspiration on how I at least write my apps. I've noticed from the past that this has helped me by watching other people write apps from a higher perspective.</p>
<p>So thats about it guys,
Thanks for listening
Bye!

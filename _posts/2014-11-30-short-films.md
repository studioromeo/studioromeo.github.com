I love short animated cartoons, it's astonishing to see how much detail the animators
can cram into a 5 minute sequence. My favourite type includes a bit of warm
cheeky humour with bright colours that make the film appear vibrant and fun.

Here is a selection of favourites on vimeo, each one I like for differing reasons
but they are all ace. I hope you enjoy!

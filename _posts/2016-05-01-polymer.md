Another talk I did back in November was on Polymer.

{% include video.html src="//www.youtube.com/embed/s4dybsEIAIs" %}

Polymer is an interesting framework which is used to create custom HTML elements using the browsers web components API's if it can.
In my talk we'll make our very own elements and use them to create a cat pinterest style application for cat lovers everywhere.

As I was recording this my screen recorder crashed which meant I had to bail from screen recording my talk. I don't think my mac likes screen recording while trying to power a projector and it's screen!

I also listed some useful links which weren't captured in the video so here are the links below:

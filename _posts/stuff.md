title: Onboarding new developers (A guide)
tags: leadership onboarding
---

I was five years old when I went into my first year of formal education. My teacher beckoned me to come over and introduced me to a new kid. He had just joined the school and didn't know anyone. I was asked to show the ropes and make them feel at home. Over the years we got to know each other, we had a lot of fun and sometimes got into a bit of trouble but so many years on we're still the best of friends.

As a "lead" developer I've had to professionally show the ropes and I've picked up a few things along the way which I'd like to share. Most of these things will come as no surprise to most of you but maybe it's useful to be reminded of them.

But why should we bother onboarding? They were hired because they were smart so they can probably figure it all out themselves right? Well yes of course they can. But in the same way that someone can figure their way out of a maze they'll get out a lot sooner if said maze also comes with a map and signposts. To summarise, Onboarding helps newbies be more productive sooner.

The other side to the coin to this is our appearance. Most of us want to seem like we have our shit together (even if secretly behind the scenes we don't) and so being organised during the first few days can provide the illusion we all want. This'll impress your newbie and they'll feel excited to be part of a team thats ðŸ”¥ and more likely to stick around for longer than a few weeks.

Despite this, most, especially agencies (sorry to pick on you) invest little in onboarding. Once the offer is accepted not much preperation is done outside of the standard HR and safety procedures. This is a such a shame because it's a golden opportunity to start the relationship on a strong footing, making the most out of eachothers time together.

In this post I'm going to focus on preparing for our newbies arrival and what we can do to make that easier.

## Give them a home

No I don't mean a actual house, but if you're seriously considering that fair play, thats one heck of a perk!

A new starter is likely to be your most engaged employee. They'll want to prove to you that you made the right call by hiring them but they'll also be anxious. They'll have left a their old job, possibly moved to another city, or even country. Simply to work with you. As a manager I'd feel quite humbled by that.

So we can return in kind by reducing some of that uncertainty. Theres few things worse as a new starter than being told that some work may be coming soon but theres nothing just yet. It's one step short of finding out the job doesn't exist anymore.

So ask yourself two vital questions:

- What will they be working on? (eg what is the goal)
- Who will they be working with? (eg what team will they be working with rather than names)

Most usually have this figured out before the hiring process but I'm always surprised by how many forget to tell the new starter after they've been hired. Giving them this information ahead of time gives them stability but helps reduce their anxiety by taking away some of the uncertainty that will be building up in the weeks before the big day.

It shouldn't be specific either. Something simple like "You'll be working with our search team to improve our search accuracy" goes a long way to reducing that uncertainty and makes your new hire more excited than anxious about their first day.

## Newbie checklist

I love this (rather overused) quote from Benjamin Franklin.

> Failure to prepare is preparing to fail

Theres a lot of bits and bobs in a software project, code repositories, issue boards, various environments, passwords, user accounts, CI tooling, slack rooms, you get the idea. A common thing that happens when someone joins a new team is they quickly discover they've not been given everything they need and so everyone on the team ends up doing the access dance.

This isn't just annoying, it's also wasteful. We're not only losing time with the newbie but also everyone else whos involved in giving them access which could involve several departments to rectify.

Creating a newbie checklist is a really nice way to avoid all this. It works like so. The team sits down and works out all the things that need access in the project. For each item they make someone the owner of giving that thing and thats it. You can also group items by role if you fancy keeping access a bit more fine grained. And thats your checklist complete! Feel free to use [my template]() as a starter!

2-3 weeks before your new starter joins you can whip out a copy of this checklist and rattle through the items, catching up with people whos items haven't been checked. The idea is to make sure that all the boxes are checked before the newbie starts so they can hit the ground running from day one.

Don't worry if you find you've missed adding things to the checklist and end up doing the dance anyway. That's just how it goes sometimes but you can now add that to the list so you'll never forget about it ever again!

## Summary

As we can see theres plenty to be getting on with before the new starter joins. The nice thing about the newbie checklist in particular is it doesn't just help the newbie but also the rest of your team too should they be missing a few things themselves.

- An good induction can make all the difference between a new hire hitting the ground running and them looking for another job.
- Our first task is to give them a home. We need to have a plan for what our new hire is going to be working on and who they will be working with.
- Give them what they need using a newbie checklist of all the bibs and bobs the project has so that our new hire can do their job without being blocked unncessarily.

Next time we'll go over planning their first few weeks and getting everyone on board with the master plan.

This post was hard to start. Infact to be truthful the intro was the last part I wrote, I don't know why the beginning is always the hardest. Perhaps it's the lack of what came before, the lack of inertia and direction that gives so much choice and yet so little inspiration. This is the third or fourth time I've tried to write this and no doubt I'll do a few more edits before this goes out.

Starts are never easy and when it comes to starting a new job thats no different. Theres so much pressure to get things right that we can often paralyse ourselves into a state of timidness. Afraid of putting a foot wrong with those we want to impress. Meanwhile on the otherside of the table the exact same thoughts are had, theres worries the new starter might not work out, or that they might not like us as a group.

Overtime all these fears settle down one way or another, Tuckmans 5 stages of group development paints a pretty accurate picture of how that goes. As a lead I've had my fair share of onboarding new people onto projects and



First's can be tough, first day at school, first job, first date. Theres so much pressure to get it right, to impress but also figure out our way around the social landscape.

It takes time for any new starter to start drumming along to the same beat

It's understandable that a new starter might be a bit nervous, not all are but generally speaking most will be nervous on their first few days.

- New starters are nervous
- Making a new starter feel at home makes them more productive sooner
- It also makes them more likely to stick around
- but not enough companies invest in this


Often companies focus on new hires productivity and yet neglect to form an induction plan before they start. But a good induction can make the difference between the new hire hitting the ground running and, worst case, them looking for a new job.

In my career as a team lead I've had the responsibility of onboarding several new members so I wanted to share with you what I've learned along the way and some tools that can help make your inductions great. Not just for their first day but also for the weeks and months afterwards too.

It all starts 2 - 3 weeks before they join. This might feel a bit strange if your inductions are typically done on the mornining of their first day but a little preperation goes a long way.

Eight years ago I was walking to the office. It was my first day and to be honest I was anxious to get it over with. Rushing through my mind was thoughts. "You're going to say the wrong thing" one of my shoulders would say, "They'll be disappointed" said the other. [As I got in and had my introduction with HR, I was then walked around the office being introduced to everyone and shown my desk. While the induction was fine it wasn't until a few weeks and months later on that I truly felt introduced.](NOTSURE)

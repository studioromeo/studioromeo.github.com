I wanted to share some of my findings for making an onboarding session a good one. Not just the first day but the days and weeks afterwards too.

A good induction starts 2-3 weeks before they join. This might feel a bit strange if your inductions are typically done just in time but trust me a little prep goes a long way and even if this is the only thing you take away from this post your inductions should improve.

## Give them a home

No I don't mean a actual house, but if you're seriously considering that fair play, thats one heck of a perk!

A new starter is likely to be your most engaged employee. They'll want to prove to you that you made the right call by hiring them but they'll also be anxious. They'll have left a their old job, possibly moved to another city, or even country. Simply to work with you. As a manager I'd feel quite humbled by that.

So we can return in kind by reducing some of that uncertainty. Theres few things worse as a new starter than being told that some work may be coming soon but theres nothing just yet. It's one step short of finding out the job doesn't exist anymore.

So ask yourself two vital questions:

- What will they be working on? (eg what is the goal)
- Who will they be working with? (eg what team will they be working with rather than names)

Most usually have this figured out before the hiring process but I'm always surprised by how many forget to tell the new starter after they've been hired. Giving them this information ahead of time gives them stability but helps reduce their anxiety by taking away some of the uncertainty that will be building up in the weeks before the big day.

It shouldn't be specific either. Something simple like "You'll be working with our search team to improve our search accuracy" goes a long way to reducing that uncertainty and makes your new hire more excited than anxious about their first day.

## Newbie checklist

Theres a lot of bits and bobs in a software project, code repositories, issue boards, various environments, passwords, user accounts, CI tooling, slack rooms, you get the idea. A common thing that happens when someone joins a new team is they quickly discover they've not been given everything they need and so everyone on the team ends up doing the access dance.

This is just annoying but it's wasteful. We're not only losing time with the newbie but also everyone else whos involved in giving them access which could at best be one team member, but at worse multiple.

Creating a newbie checklist is a really nice way to avoid all this. Feel free to use my template as a starter. It works like so. The team sits down and works out all the things that need access in the project. For each item they make someone the owner of giving that thing and thats it. You can also group items by role if you fancy keeping access a bit more fine grained. And thats your checklist complete!

2-3 weeks before your new starter joins you can whip out a copy of this checklist and rattle through the items, catching up with people whos items haven't been checked. The idea is to make sure that all the boxes are checked before the newbie starts so they can hit the ground running from day one.

Don't worry if you find you've missed adding things to the checklist and end up doing the dance anyway. That's just how it goes sometimes but you can now add that to the list so you'll never forget about it ever again!

## Plan their week(s)

Next up is to start planning out the week. It's important to get this right, too compressed and it'll be exhausting for everyone involved, to spaced out and it might start to feel slow.

I start out by listing all the topics I want to cover. Starting from a high level overview and then walking them through their first ticket giving guidance on each step of the process just in time. I find this is the best way to learn rather than brain dumping in a presentation which people forget as soon as it's over. Here's an example of a syllabus I put together for my most recent onboarding.

[ Insert example ]

After I've got a basic syllabus together I lay it all out on a spreadsheet. This is super handy because I can at a glance see how their week is looking. If it's a big block of colour I've over done it, if it's a wall of white then it's too little and I need to add more. I can also see what type of info is being exchanged via the use of colour coding. Eg Purple = People, Orange = Technical, Blue = Management, Green = Other so we can ensure a healthy mix of topics.

Context switching is another thing to watch out for as it deprives people of energy and their ability to absorb information. It's a good idea to never put two different colour blocks together and ideally provide a gap of around
30 minutes between sessions so they can gather themselves beforehand.

When they start we can shuffle the spreadsheet around based on how they're doing. If they're finding it a bit tough going we can lengthen it out, or if they're racing through we can compress it. We also have our syllabus to make sure we're covering all the topics that need to be covered as it's easy to forget in the moment.

As a manager I've found this tool invaluable as it's helped keep me organised but also able to react to the situation as it develops.

I've provided some templates for a [syllabus] and the [calendar spreadsheet] for you to use.

during an induction is not a great time to be doing this kind of planning as you're having to keep in touch with the newbie, but also contiue to do the day job. So to have somewhere where this is that be easily edited

I found this tool invaluable for other reasons too, it was a great guide to see when I should ask for updates or when I should back off and let them get on because they've been busy with meetings.




We can start with laying out topics to go over. I won't cover the usual legal and health and safety stuff here as that really depends on where you live but regardless of all that theres a few key things that happen

- Meeting the team
- overview of the week
- Project walkthrough (goals, client etc)
- Product walkthrough (thing itself)
- Process walkthrough (how teams work)
- Checking essentials
- Q&A seshes
- Setup of project
- Deeper insight of the code
- First ticket assignment and walkthrough
- How to check work and submit
- Work approval process (PR)
- How to get work published
- Intro to client

- Intro with other teams & areas

So quite a lot!

The other thing to factor in is fatigue and context switching.
Try to spread this out as much as possible to avoid fatigue
And mark out context switching time between sessions.

Use spreadsheets to visualize their week. color coding ftw

Two goals:
- Work out induction structure starting high level and working down
- See how full their day is. try and spread out stuff so they have time to process and recover

## Walk through with team

- Make sure everyone knows what is happening
- And what they need to do

## Summary

- Provide a new home. Have a plan for what they will be working on and who they'll be working with
- Give them what they need. Make a checklist of logins, assets, etc they need to do their job. Assign people to provide
that access and crack on.
- Plan their week. Plotting out their week

First post
Before they join
- Walk through the newbie checklist
- Organise their week (charting, todo list)
- Talk through the plan with everyone involved














Eight years ago I remember waking up in a Premier Inn in Cardiff. It was early, the city was quiet except for the
occasional street cleaner sweeping up the remainders of the party goers the night before. I was particularly nervous,
worried about what might happen later on.

I grabbed breakfast, which surprised the waitresses as I walked through the door as soon as they opened.
Cup of tea in hand I wondered how the day would go. Would I say something bad? What if I couldn't
do what they asked? Would I make any friends? I would look down at my watch every minute, keeping an eye on the clock
praying for 9am to never arrive so I wouldn't have to go through the day.

It was my first day at work. 9AM I walked through the door. Sat down in reception and was prompty
escourted around the building being introduced all the staff that worked there. Meanwhile I was desperately trying to
remember everyones names and appear unwavingly enthusastic.

I was shown my desk and then...nothing. I was adrift in a new city not knowing what I was supposed to be doing or who to ask.

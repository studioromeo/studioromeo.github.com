Since that time I've introduced plenty of staff to the company and I wanted to share some of my findings for making an
onboarding session a good one. Not just the first day but the days and weeks afterwards too.

A good induction begins before their first day. What? you might be thinking. How can I introduce someone before they've
even arrived? Well you're right, you can't but theres plenty to do beforehand.

## Provide a new home

Uncertainty is a bitch. It makes even the strongest individuals crumble into an anxious mess. We don't
want our newbies first impression of our company to be one of a ship with no captain.

Plans do change and thats fine, no one is asking you to predict the future. But your newbie has just left a stable
job, possibly moved to another city, maybe even country. All for you. You owe it to them to provide some sembelence of
stability.

The first rule of a great induction is to provide a new home.

Ask yourself:

- What are they working on?
- Who are they working with?

Answering these questions provides a much needed foundation which all our other tasks hang from. Having a backup incase
plan A fails is also wise.

## Give them what they need

How many times have you been in an induction and you've not got access to something you need? Yep me too. It's
super frustrating as now we have to call someone over (hello anxiety ðŸ‘‹). They likely then have to ask someone
else and it all turns into a bit of a mess.

The second rule of a great induction is to **give them what they need from day one**.

That means access to everything, even if they don't need it right away. What we're talking about is user accounts,
access to files, passwords, slack rooms, email etc. Believe it or not it can be surprisingly hard to list down everything
down. You likely won't get it right first time and thats okay, but if you did? Well done!

Checklists are a great format for this and I've developed a [newbie checklist which you can download to use
yourself](). For each item you decide whether its something everyone needs or just a certain role. And then you assign a
person to ensure that thing gets done. Remember time is of the essence!

When it's known that someone will be joining the team you can copy your checklist, name it after the person joining and
rattle through it. Giving you that smug feeling that your newbie isn't going to have problems logging into X or downloading Y.

Don't fret if you find you've missed things on the checklist, it's a living document which you can add to
over time. But importantly newbies will be silently grateful for having all this 'just work'.

## Plan their week

Two goals:
- Work out induction structure starting high level and working down
- See how full their day is. try and spread out stuff so they have time to process and recover

## Walk through with team

- Make sure everyone knows what is happening
- And what they need to do

## Summary

- Provide a new home. Have a plan for what they will be working on and who they'll be working with
- Give them what they need. Make a checklist of logins, assets, etc they need to do their job. Assign people to provide
that access and crack on.
- Plan their week. Plotting out their week

First post
Before they join
- Walk through the newbie checklist
- Organise their week (charting, todo list)
- Talk through the plan with everyone involved














Eight years ago I remember waking up in a Premier Inn in Cardiff. It was early, the city was quiet except for the
occasional street cleaner sweeping up the remainders of the party goers the night before. I was particularly nervous,
worried about what might happen later on.

I grabbed breakfast, which surprised the waitresses as I walked through the door as soon as they opened.
Cup of tea in hand I wondered how the day would go. Would I say something bad? What if I couldn't
do what they asked? Would I make any friends? I would look down at my watch every minute, keeping an eye on the clock
praying for 9am to never arrive so I wouldn't have to go through the day.

It was my first day at work. 9AM I walked through the door. Sat down in reception and was prompty
escourted around the building being introduced all the staff that worked there. Meanwhile I was desperately trying to
remember everyones names and appear unwavingly enthusastic.

I was shown my desk and then...nothing. I was adrift in a new city not knowing what I was supposed to be doing or who to ask.

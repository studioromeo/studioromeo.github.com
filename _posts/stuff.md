title: Onboarding new developers (A guide)
tags: leadership onboarding

As a "lead" developer I've shown the ropes a few times and I've picked up things along the way which I'd like to share with you folks. I imagine a lot of these things are fairly obvious but hey if reading this article starts a new thread for you then i'm counting that as a win! And if you've not thought about these things before then let's crack on!

If you're sold on the idea of onboarding you can skip this bit, but if not, why should we care about onboarding people? 

I kinda feel like most peoples aversion to onboarding comes from a feeling of a lack of value. Spending time showing someone the ropes is wasteful and only valuable to one person at the cost of the rest of the team / organisation. And besides they were hired because they were smart so they can probably figure it out themselves right? 

Well yes they probably could... But in the same way we can figure out a route through the maze we'll get out a lot sooner if the maze comes complete with a map and signposts. In a nutshell, onboarding helps us all become more productive sooner.

The other side to the coin is our appearance, most of us want to seem like we have our shit together (even if secretly behind the scenes we don't). Our newbies will be hypersensitive to how things are working in the way that we are no longer and it'll tell them a lot about how good we _really_ are. So by having a plan this can push the notion that we're in control and that they are indeed working for a shit hot company ðŸ”¥

But for me the best part about onboarding is it works as a self reflection tool. How good are you really? Working through an onboarding with a newbie will hightlight all the kinks and bumps about ourselves, the project, how we work that we are unlikely to discover on our own. So it'd be a crying shame to miss out on all that for the sake of attending some extra meetings to discuss the life / death topic of whether a component should be called a header or heading.

So hopefully I've convinced you just enough to keep reading. In this post we're going to walk through what preparation we can do before our newbie joins.

## What is their purpose?

This ideally should have happened before the recruitment stage, but sometimes this doesn't happen or the original plan is disgarded for one reason or another.

Plans change but if we're going through the expense of recuritment then we should have backup plans should our original purpose come to pass. Our newbie has taken a big leap of faith, they've quit their job, possibly moved to another city..maybe even country, to work for us. Theres not many greater demonstrations of commitment than that so the least we can do is give them that certainty that we need them just as much as they need us.

It's a great idea to send a message to our newbie that:

- Thanks them for joining our company
- Shareing the our values and what we're about.
- What they'll be working on
- Who they'll be working with (no names but teams / departments are good non personal communication devices)
- (If not the author) Who to speak to about questions they might have beforehand

Some companies go a step further and post hampers to their newbie's with their products to help get them familier with what they produce, others send company handbooks (eg Valve) that give the lowdown on what it's like to work at the company.

This sounds like a lot but it can really be a simple as a single sentence "Thanks for joining us. We're a leading  ______ and you'll be working on our  ______ team improving ______. See you soon! " goes a long way to reducing uncertainty and makes our newbie more excited than anxious about their first day.

By saying this we're opening up a discussion early, not letting anxiety brew. It lets the newbie ask questions they might not have felt comfortable asking before, or simply didn't cross their mind. 

## Newbie checklist

I love this (rather overused) quote from [Benjamin Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin).

> Failure to prepare is preparing to fail

Theres a lot of bits and bobs in a software project, code repositories, issue boards, various environments, passwords, user accounts, CI tooling, slack rooms, you get the idea. A common thing that happens when someone joins a new team is they quickly discover they've not been given everything they need and so everyone on the team ends up doing the access dance.

This isn't just annoying, it's also wasteful. We're not only losing time with the newbie but also everyone else whos involved in giving them access which could involve several departments to rectify.

A way to avoid this dance is to create a list of all the things that someone is likely to need to do their job thats outside of the usual (eg I wouldn't list things like laptop, thats pretty obvious but if you feel it's worth noting by all means). We can also divide the list into departments if some things are specific to a role (eg a developer might not need a sketch licence but a designer might). For each item we make someone the owner of doing that thing, because accountability is important so that stuff gets done!

2-3 weeks before your new starter joins we can whip out a copy of this checklist and rattle through the items, catching up with people whos responsible for unchecked items. The idea is to make sure that all the boxes are ticked before the newbie starts so they can hit the ground running from day one.

Feel free to use [my template]() as a starter.

And don't worry if you find you've missed adding things to the checklist and end up doing the dance anyway. That's just how it goes sometimes but you can now add that to the list so you'll never forget about it ever again!

## Plan their week(s)

Okay so we know what we want them to do and we've given access to the things they'll need to do what they do! Next up it's time to start planning out their first few weeks. There's quite a few things that go into an induction, such as introductions, explaining various processes and getting familiar with the product. We also want to get them making stuff as soon as possible for both business and motivation reasons.

The brain is a muscle and like any muscle it needs stimulating at the right pace. If we compress our weeks we risk over training but if we spread out too much we risk making little progress for the time we've invested.

To make sense of all this we start listing all the things we want to go over, high level stuff such as meeting the team and what the project is about to deeper things like submitting pull requests. Try and think of any unwritten rules or cultures too as these can sometimes crop up at unfortunate times if not covered. Don't worry about the ordering just list everything down. To give you a flavour heres a list I did recently

- Meeting the team
- Overview of the week
- Project walkthrough (goals, client etc)
- Product walkthrough (the thing)
- Process walkthrough (how teams work)
- Checking essentials
- Q&A seshes
- Setup of project
- Deeper insight of the code (basic structure, conventions etc)
- First ticket assignment and walkthrough
- How to check work and submit
- Work approval process (PR)
- How to get work published
- Intro to client
- Intro with other teams

Once we've got our list together we can start to colour code the items based on their subject. I use this key Purple = People, Orange = Technical, Blue = Management. We do this so we can get an idea of what our list is like and whether we might be missing topics. Eg if it's a sea of purple and they're a developer...perhaps we're missing some technical training? Colour coding will later help us when we come to lay these out onto a timeframe where we can see that we're delivering information in the right order.

Now we've got our list together and it's colour coded we can move onto laying this out. I've got an [example spreadsheet]() that you can use as a base. I don't use a calendar because not all items are events that I need or want to be booked. For each item i usually give around 30 minutes, I find that roughly works out for me but honestly give as much time as you think you'll need everyones different! 

This spreadsheet is one of my favourite tools because you can see at a high level what their induction is going to look like and play around with it.

Here's a few tips to keep in mind when planning out the weeks:

- Provide a lay of the land to begin with and start basic. They really don't need to know the ins and outs of our release process on day one. As the days progress and they settle in we can increase our level of detail until we've covered everything we want to cover.
- Avoid brain dumping and give plenty of time for rest. This is so they've got time to process what you've been saying, maybe practice some techniques you've shown and generally get their heads straight. 
- Try to keep items grouped by their purpose. Don't switch from meeting the team to explaining how to file a pull request to talking about the project, It's really confusing and chances are they'll forget most of what you're saying which kind of defeats the point doesn't it? Instead try and group things into chunks of related items, so maybe meet the team + project overview + demo of the product and thats it. Let that sink in and then we can move onto other things like setting up. The colourcoding can really help here as if we see a rainbow it might not be a well structured block.
- Aim to provide information just in time. So for example rather than explaining to them the pull request process radomly, wait for when they've completed some work and want to push it up for review. Because when theres a real and specific need theres a greater chance that they'll be paying attention and absorb what you're saying, plus you can teach by doing which is handy for those of us that are kinesthetic learners.

Theres probably loads I've missed here but these are the key points I think...

When they start we can shuffle the spreadsheet around based on how they're doing. If they're finding it a bit tough going we can lengthen it out, or if they're racing through we can compress it. We also have our syllabus to make sure we're covering all the topics that need to be covered as it's easy to forget in the moment.

As a manager I've found this tool invaluable as it's helped keep me organised but also able to react to the situation as it develops.

## Summary

So theres oodles to be getting on with before the new starter joins. I really like the newbie checklist because it not only helps new starters but we can use it on the rest of the team to make sure they have everything too! 

- An induction can make all the difference between a new hire hitting the ground running and not
- Well planned inductions can make an organisation feel like a great place to work
- They can be used as an opportunity for self reflection to see where the issues might be
- Our first task is to let them know what they'll be going to be working on and who they will be working with.
- Give them what they need from day one by making a newbie checklist of all the bibs and bobs the project has and running through it for each newbie that joins
- Write out an induction plan and lay it out in a spreadsheet
- Start small and general to begin with and get progressively more detailed
- Group items together to help the content flow logically
- Provide information just in time and avoid brain dumping.

We've got our plan now so we can be rest easy knowing we're prepared for their arrival. In the next post we'll go over their first day.

Once you've listed all these items out colour code them based on their topics

This is so we can get an idea of our mix of topics and whether we might be missing coverage on a category. In some of my earlier inductions I've focused so heavily on the people side of things that I completely neglected the Technical part and so this is a way of combating that bias.

After I've got a basic syllabus together I lay it all out on a spreadsheet. This is super handy because I can at a glance see how their week is looking. If it's a big block of colour I've over done it, if it's a blank wall then theres room for onboarding. We can reuse the colour coding too to help us see what kind of content is being taught on any given day.

Try to structure it so that they're able to create something as soon as possible, theres no better feeling than making something with your own hands that others value so organise with that as your goal. It might not always be possible but that should be the goal.





Context switching is another thing to watch out for as it can really rob us all of energy and our ability to absorb information. Try to keep that in mind and group items together of the same topic (eg a block of people subjects). 



 Keep that in mind and try to allow large gaps of space between sessions 30 minutes between sessions so they can gather themselves beforehand.





Next up is to start planning out the week. It's important to get this right, too compressed and it'll be exhausting for everyone involved, to spaced out and it might start to feel slow.

I start out by listing all the topics I want to cover. Starting from a high level overview and then walking them through their first ticket giving guidance on each step of the process just in time. I find this is the best way to learn rather than brain dumping in a presentation which people forget as soon as it's over. Here's an example of a syllabus I put together for my most recent onboarding to give you an idea.

After I've got a basic syllabus together I lay it all out on a spreadsheet. This is super handy because I can at a glance see how their week is looking. If it's a big block of colour I've over done it, if it's a blank wall then theres room for onboarding. I can also see what type of info is being exchanged via the use of colour coding. Eg Purple = People, Orange = Technical, Blue = Management, Green = Other so we can ensure a healthy mix of topics.





I've provided some templates for a [syllabus]() and the [calendar spreadsheet]() for you to use.

This post was hard to start. Infact to be truthful the intro was the last part I wrote, I don't know why the beginning is always the hardest. Perhaps it's the lack of what came before, the lack of inertia and direction that gives so much choice and yet so little inspiration. This is the third or fourth time I've tried to write this and no doubt I'll do a few more edits before this goes out.

Starts are never easy and when it comes to starting a new job thats no different. Theres so much pressure to get things right that we can often paralyse ourselves into a state of timidness. Afraid of putting a foot wrong with those we want to impress. Meanwhile on the otherside of the table the exact same thoughts are had, theres worries the new starter might not work out, or that they might not like us as a group.

Overtime all these fears settle down one way or another, Tuckmans 5 stages of group development paints a pretty accurate picture of how that goes. As a lead I've had my fair share of onboarding new people onto projects and



First's can be tough, first day at school, first job, first date. Theres so much pressure to get it right, to impress but also figure out our way around the social landscape.

It takes time for any new starter to start drumming along to the same beat

It's understandable that a new starter might be a bit nervous, not all are but generally speaking most will be nervous on their first few days.

- New starters are nervous
- Making a new starter feel at home makes them more productive sooner
- It also makes them more likely to stick around
- but not enough companies invest in this


Often companies focus on new hires productivity and yet neglect to form an induction plan before they start. But a good induction can make the difference between the new hire hitting the ground running and, worst case, them looking for a new job.

In my career as a team lead I've had the responsibility of onboarding several new members so I wanted to share with you what I've learned along the way and some tools that can help make your inductions great. Not just for their first day but also for the weeks and months afterwards too.

It all starts 2 - 3 weeks before they join. This might feel a bit strange if your inductions are typically done on the mornining of their first day but a little preperation goes a long way.

Eight years ago I was walking to the office. It was my first day and to be honest I was anxious to get it over with. Rushing through my mind was thoughts. "You're going to say the wrong thing" one of my shoulders would say, "They'll be disappointed" said the other. [As I got in and had my introduction with HR, I was then walked around the office being introduced to everyone and shown my desk. While the induction was fine it wasn't until a few weeks and months later on that I truly felt introduced.](NOTSURE)

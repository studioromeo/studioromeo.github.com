This is my second talk of the year and first duet with [Christelle](https://twitter.com/littlecrome) (I'm not sure if thats the right terminology but lets run with it). At [Box](https://boxuk.com) whenever someone goes to a conference they can do a short talk to summarise the event for those who couldn't attend.

Responsive day out is a front-end focused conference sharing tips and tricks on workflow, techniques and experiences on dealing with a responsive web. The nice thing about this conference was it contained both devs and designers!

We both found this one tough for the following reasons:

- We needed to deliver it soon after coming back so that the day remained fresh in our heads but we were also very busy at the time
- The conference was intense even by single day standards and a lot of ground was covered in a short space of time. Compressing this into a 30 minute chunk and retaining its structure was tough
- Making sure we both felt we contributed equally was also really hard

The talk was well received with most saying it was the best that they had experienced of this type! :smile:

The conference was a blast and I really enjoyed producing this talk with [Christelle](https://twitter.com/littlecrome). Hopefully we can do it again someday!

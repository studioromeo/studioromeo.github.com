title: Better onboarding

As a lead developer I've had to show the ropes a few times and I've picked up a some things along the way which I'd like to share with you folks. I imagine a lot of this will be fairly obvious but hey if reading this article starts a new thread for you then I'm counting that as a win!

If you're already sold on the idea of onboarding you can [skip this bit](#what-is-their-purpose) but if not, why should we care about onboarding people? 

I feel like the main aversion to onboarding comes from a feeling of a lack of return on investment. Spending time showing someone the ropes feels wasteful and only valuable to one person at the cost of the rest of the team / organisation. And besides they were hired because they were smart so they can probably figure it out themselves right? 

Well yea they probably could... but in the same way we can figure out a route through the maze, we'll get out a lot sooner if the maze comes complete with a map and signposts. **In a nutshell, onboarding helps us all become more productive sooner.**

The other side to the coin is our appearance, most of us want to seem like we have our sh*t together (even if secretly behind the scenes we don't). Our newbies will be hypersensitive to how things work (both process & tech) and it'll tell them a lot about how good we _really_ are. So by having a plan this can push the notion that we're in control and that they are working for a company that knows what it's doing and where it's going.

But for me the best part about onboarding is it works as a self reflection tool. How good are you *really*? 

Working through an onboarding process with a newbie will hightlight all the kinks and bumps about ourselves, the project, and how we work that we are unlikely to discover on our own. So it'd be a crying shame to miss out on all that for the sake of maybe having a few more hours to churn out code and/or sit in meetings.

So hopefully I've convinced you just enough to keep reading. In this post we're going to walk through what preparation we can do before our newbie joins.

## What is their purpose?

This ideally should have happened before the recruitment stage, but sometimes this doesn't happen or the original plan is disgarded for one reason or another.

Plans change but if we're going through the expense of recuritment then we should have backup plans should the original purpose come to pass. Our newbie has taken a big leap of faith, they've quit their job, possibly moved to another city...maybe even country, to work for us. Theres not many greater demonstrations of commitment than that so the least we can do is give them that certainty that we need them just as much as they need us.

It's a great idea to send a message to our newbie that:

- Thanks them for joining our company.
- Shares our values and what we're about.
- What they'll be working on.
- Who they'll be working with (no names but teams / departments are good non personal communication devices).
- Who to speak to about questions they might have beforehand.

Some companies go a step further and post hampers to newbie's with their products to help get them familier with what they produce. Others send company handbooks (eg Valve) that give the lowdown on what it's like to work at the company.

This sounds like a lot but a single sentence *"Thanks for joining us. We're a leading  `__________` and you'll be working on our  `__________` team improving `__________`. See you soon! "* goes a long way to reducing uncertainty and makes our newbie more excited than anxious about their first day.

By stating this we're opening up a discussion early, not letting anxiety brew. It lets the newbie ask questions they might not have felt comfortable asking before, or simply didn't cross their mind. 

## Newbie checklist

I love this (rather clichÃ©) quote from [Benjamin Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin).

> Failure to prepare is preparing to fail

Theres a lot of bits and bobs in a software project, code repositories, issue boards, various environments, passwords, user accounts, CI tooling, slack rooms, you get the idea. A common scenario that happens when someone joins a new team is they quickly discover they've not been given everything they need and so everyone on the team ends up doing the access dance ðŸ’ƒ.

This isn't just annoying, it's also wasteful. We're not only spending the newbie's time but also everyone else whos involved in giving them access which could involve several departments to rectify.

A way to avoid this dance is to create a list of all the stuff that someone is likely to need to do their job on the project. We can also divide the list into departments if some things are specific to a role, e.g. a developer might not need a sketch licence but a designer would. For each item we make someone the owner of doing that thing, because accountability is important to ensure stuff gets done!

2 to 3 weeks before your new starter joins we can whip out a copy of this checklist and rattle through the items, catching up with people whos responsible for the unchecked ones. The idea is to make sure that all the boxes are ticked before the newbie starts so they can hit the ground running from day one.

I've created a [basic template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZvYrp3HsTH1tx0qXNyMgBvdsxMGR9Zt6-nBhdpwfebo) to give you an idea of what we're shooting for and to get you started. Try to add everything that team mates will need on the project. Even if its something that they'll use infrequently note it down so you know they have access to it when the time comes.

And don't worry if you find you've missed adding things to the checklist and end up doing the dance anyway. That's just how it goes sometimes but you can now add that to the list so you'll never forget about it ever again!

## Plan their week(s)

Okay so we now know what we want them to do and we've given access to all the things they need! Next up it's time to start planning out their first few weeks. There's quite a few things that go into an induction, such as introductions, walking through various processes and getting familiar with the product. We also want to get them making stuff as soon as possible for both business and motivational reasons.

The brain is a muscle and like any muscle it needs stimulating at the right pace. If we compress our weeks we risk over training but if we spread out too much we risk making slow progress.

To make sense of all this we can start listing all the things we want to go over, high level items such as meeting the team and what the project is about progressing to more in-depth things like submitting pull requests and how a part of the codebase works. Try and think of any unwritten rules or cultures too as these can sometimes crop up at unfortunate times if not covered and cause distress. Don't worry about the ordering focus on listing everything down.

To give you a flavour heres a list I did recently

- Meeting the team
- Overview of the week
- Project walkthrough (goals, client etc)
- Product walkthrough (the thing)
- Process walkthrough (how teams work)
- Checking essentials
- Q&A seshes
- Setup of project
- Deeper insight of the code (basic structure, conventions etc)
- First ticket assignment and walkthrough
- How to check work and submit
- Work approval process (PR)
- How to get work published
- Intro to client
- Intro with other teams

Once we've got our list together we can start to colour code the items based on the subject. I use this key Purple = People, Orange = Technical, Blue = Management. We do this so we can get an idea of what our list is like and whether we might be missing topics. If it's a sea of purple and they're a developer, perhaps we're missing some technical training?

Now we've got our list together and it's colour coded we can move onto laying this out. I have an [example spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-umV7JbM_ugXetfr40LBrlGJqWPTfuU5KielHge12V8/edit?usp=sharing) that you can use as a base. I don't use a calendar because not all items are events that I need or want to be officially booked. For each item I usually give around 30 minutes, I find that roughly works out for me but honestly give as much time as you think you'll need everyone's different! 

This spreadsheet is one of my favourite tools because you can see at a high level what their induction is going to look like and play around with it.

Here's a few tips to keep in mind when planning:

- **Provide a lay of the land to begin with and start basic.** They really don't need to know the ins and outs of our release process on day one. As the days progress and they settle in we can increase our level of detail until we've covered everything we want to cover.
- **Avoid brain dumping and give plenty of time for rest.** This is so they've got time to process what's been said, practice some techniques you've shown and generally get their heads straight. 
- **Try to keep items grouped by their purpose.** Don't switch from meeting the team, to explaining how to file a pull request, to talking about the project. It's really confusing and chances are they'll forget most of what you're saying which kind of defeats the point doesn't it? Instead try and group things into chunks of related content, so maybe meet the team + project overview + demo of the product and thats it. Let that sink in and then we can move onto other things like setting up. The colour coding can really help here as if we see a rainbow it might be a sign that we need some space.
- **Aim to provide information just in time.** So for example rather than explaining to them the pull request process radomly, wait for when they've completed some work and want to push it up for review. Because when theres a real and specific need theres a greater chance that they'll be paying attention and absorb what you're saying. Plus you can teach by doing which is handy for those of us that are kinesthetic learners.

When they start out we can shuffle the spreadsheet around based on how they're doing. If they're finding it a bit tough going we can lengthen it out, or if they're racing through we can compress it.

As a manager I've found this tool invaluable as it's helped keep me organised but also able to react to the situation as it develops.

## Summary

So theres oodles to be getting on with before the new starter joins. I really like the newbie checklist because it not only helps new starters but we can use it on the rest of the team to make sure they have everything too! 

- An induction can make all the difference between a new hire hitting the ground running and not.
- Well planned inductions can make an organisation feel like a great place to work.
- They can be used as an opportunity for self reflection to see where improvements can be made.
- Our first task is to let them know what they'll be going to be working on and who they will be working with.
- Give them what they need from day one by making a newbie checklist of all the bibs and bobs the project has and running through it for each newbie that joins
- Write out an induction plan and lay it out in a spreadsheet
- Start small and general to begin with and get progressively more detailed
- Group items together to help the content flow logically
- Provide information just in time and avoid brain dumping.

We've got our plan now so we can be rest easy knowing we're prepared for their arrival. In the next part we'll go over their first day.

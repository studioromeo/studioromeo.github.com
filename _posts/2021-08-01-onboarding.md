title: A Few Simple Steps to Improve Your Onboarding Experience
tags: leadership onboarding
---

As a technical lead I've shown the ropes a few times and along the way I've picked up a some things I'd like to share. This may be fairly obvious but hey, if reading this article starts a new thread for you then I'm counting that as a win!

If you're already sold on the idea of onboarding you can [skip this bit](#1-what-is-their-purpose) otherwise, why should we care about onboarding people?

I feel the main aversion to onboarding is the feeling of a lack of return on investment. Spending the teams time into a single individual feels expensive and besides they were hired because they were smart so they can figure it out themselves right?

Well yea they probably could... but in the same way we can figure a way out of the maze, we'll get out a lot sooner if the maze comes complete with a map and signposts. 

**In a nutshell, onboarding helps the team become more productive sooner.**

Most of us want to seem like we have our sh*t together, even if secretly behind the scenes we don't. Our newbies will be hypersensitive to how things work behind the scenes (both process & tech) and it'll tell them a lot about how good we _really_ are. So by having a plan we seem like we're in control and know what we're doing, even if we don't!

But for me the best part about onboarding is it works as a self reflection tool. How good are you *really*?

It hightlights all the kinks and bumps about ourselves, the project, and how we work that we are unlikely to discover on our own. So it'd be a crying shame to miss out on all that for the sake of maybe having a few more hours to play with.

Hopefully I've convinced you just enough to keep reading. In this post we're going to walk through what preparation we can do before our newbie joins.

## 1. What is their purpose?

Our newbie has taken a big leap of faith, they've quit their job, possibly moved to another city...maybe even country, to work for us. Theres not many greater demonstrations of commitment than that so the least we can do is give them clarity over what they've signed up to and that you're just as committed to the relationship as they are.

It's a great idea to send a message to our newbie that:

- Thanks them for joining our company.
- Shares our values and what we're about.
- What they'll be working on.
- Who they'll be working with (no names but teams / departments are good non personal communication devices).
- Who to speak to about questions they might have beforehand.

Some go a step further and post hampers to newbie's with their products to help get them familier with what they produce. Others send handbooks that give the lowdown on what it's like to work at the company.

This sounds like a lot but a short email that says *"Thanks for joining us. We're a leading  `__________` and you'll be working on our  `__________` team improving `__________`. Looking forward to seeing you soon! "* goes a long way to reducing uncertainty and helps our newbie feel less anxious and more excited about their first day.

We're also opening up the discussion early, it enables them ask questions they might not have felt comfortable asking before, or simply didn't cross their mind. 

## 2. Newbie checklist

I love this (rather clichÃ©) quote from [Benjamin Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin).

> Failure to prepare is preparing to fail

And with that in mind theres a lot of bits and bobs in a software project, code repositories, issue boards, passwords, CI tooling, slack rooms, you get the idea. 

A common scenario when someone joins a new team is they discover they've not been given everything they need and so everyone on the team ends up doing the access dance ðŸ’ƒ rushing to find the person responsible who can provide them with the key.

[insert keymaster gif]

This isn't just annoying, it's also wasteful. We're spending the newbie's time and everyone else whos involved in giving them access which could involve several departments to rectify.

Instead we can create a list of all the tools, services & other stuff that's needed to do their job on the project. We can divide the list into departments if some items are specific to a role, e.g. a developer might not need a sketch licence but a designer would. Accountability is important to ensure stuff gets done so we assign an owner for each item.

2 to 3 weeks before our newbie starts we can whip out a copy of this checklist and rattle through the items, catching up with people whos responsible for the unchecked ones. The idea is to make sure that all the boxes are ticked beforehand so they can hit the ground running from day one.

I've created a [basic template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZvYrp3HsTH1tx0qXNyMgBvdsxMGR9Zt6-nBhdpwfebo) to get you started. Try to add everything that team mates will need on the project. Even if its something that they'll use infrequently note it down so you know they have access to it when the time comes.

And don't worry if you find you've missed a few things and end up doing the access dance anyway, that's just how it goes sometimes. Be sure to add it to the list so you'll never forget about it ever again!

## 3. Plan their week(s)

Okay so we now know what we want them to do and we've given access to all the things they need! Things are cooking! Next up it's time to start planning out what their first few weeks will be like.

There's quite a few things that go into an induction, such as introductions, processes, orientation etc. We also want to get them making things as soon as possible for both business and motivational reasons.

To make sense of all this we can start by listing all the things we want to go over, high level items such as meeting the team and what the project is about progressing to more in-depth things like submitting pull requests and how a part of the codebase works. Try and think of any unwritten rules or cultures too as these can sometimes crop up at unfortunate times if not covered. Don't worry about the ordering focus on listing everything down.

To give you a flavour heres a list I did recently

- Meeting the team
- Overview of the week
- Project walkthrough (goals, stakeholders etc)
- Product walkthrough (the thing)
- Process walkthrough (how the team works together)
- Checking essentials (do they have everything and know how to get to it?)
- Q&A sessions
- Setup of project
- Deeper insight of the code (basic structure, conventions etc)
- First ticket assignment and walkthrough
- How to check work and submit
- Work approval process (PR)
- How to get work published
- Intro to client / stakeholders
- Intro with other teams that they may work with

Once we've got our list together we can start to colour code the items based on the subject, I use this key Purple = People, Orange = Technical, Blue = Management. This gives an idea of what our list is like and whether we might be missing topics. If it's a sea of purple and they're a developer, perhaps we're missing some technical training?

Now we've got our list together and it's colour coded we can move onto laying this out. I have an [example spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-umV7JbM_ugXetfr40LBrlGJqWPTfuU5KielHge12V8/edit?usp=sharing) that you can use as a base. For each item I usually give around 30 minutes, I find that roughly works out for me but honestly give as much time as you think you'll need.

This spreadsheet is one of my favourite tools because we can see at a high level what their induction is going to look like and play around with it.

Here's a few tips to keep in mind when planning:

- **Provide a lay of the land to begin with and start basic.** They really don't need to know the ins and outs of our release process on day one. As they settle in we can increase our level of detail until we've covered everything we want to cover.
- **Avoid brain dumping and give plenty of time for rest.** Give them time to process what's been said, practice some techniques you've shown and generally get their heads straight.
- **Try to keep items grouped by their subject.** Don't mix subjects like meeting the team + filing a pull request + Project Management. It's really confusing and chances are they'll forget most of what you're saying which defeats the point doesn't it? Instead group related content, so maybe meet the team + project overview + demo of the product. The colour coding can help visualise how organised we are, rainbows are a bad sign here.
- **Aim to provide information just in time.** For example rather than explaining to them the pull request process randomly, wait for when they want to submit their code. When theres a real and specific need theres a greater chance that they'll absorb what you're saying. Plus you can teach by doing which is handy for those of us that are kinesthetic learners.

When they start out we can shuffle the spreadsheet around based on how they're doing. If things are taking longer than you imagined no problem, lengthen it out a smidge, or if you're finding you're both racing through compress it. It's important to remain fluid during the induction, the spreadsheet isn't there to set things in stone but rather act as a guide to help you organise the days in a logical manner.

As a manager I've found this tool invaluable as it's helped keep me organised but also able to react to the situation as it develops.

#### Walk through the plan with the team

Okay cool you've got the plan laid out, now is the time to grab the rest of the team and walk them through it. This is a great opportunity to sanity check the plan and make sure you haven't missed anything crucial. Be sure to ask for feedback early as when the newbie joins it'll be more difficult and ultimately stressful to organise activities especially if you need someone elses help.

It's also a good time to talk to others and discuss who is best to run through parts of the induction. For instance, the general project overview may be best left to someone like the Product Owner, whereas the technical architecture? Well that sounds like a job for the technical lead. Put who's running the session down on the plan.

Small tip here: pay attention to your teams reactions when they're given an assignment, some members may be less comfortable than others at running a session solo and if thats the case offering in a tacful way to be with them in session may allieviate some of that anxiety. It's natural to focus on the needs of the newbie during an induction but the needs of your team matter just as much.

## 4. Write a clear & concise project readme

This is probably more one for the devs but I think it could apply to anyone at a high level. Write a clear readme!

In my experience there seems to be two types of readme. The first one is baron, like a desert, devoid of any information that leaves you hunting through other files in the repository searching for clues. The latter is the one is like a pile of cables, a mass of information in random order it's not clear where to start.

Take the time to organise a concise setup readme so that it's a sinch to get the project working. In general there are 3 main sections to cover:

- **Pre-requisits:** - What do they need before they can start following the readme? Usually this is software such as a version of NodeJS or Figma, that kinda thing. But it could also extend to certain passwords or to have setup another project first.
- **Installation:** - The main course! Provide simple step by step instructions on how to install the project. Provide code snippets in a common format that readers can simply copy and paste if possible. Optimise this step for the most walked path and skip any of the non-essentials.
- **Common Usage:** - Are there any common tasks in the project? In code theres usually how to run the project or the linter / tests.

Once you've got the initial readme nailed you can move onto documenting the more niche topics of the project. Providing a useful links section down below is also a good move so that you can signpost the readers to other parts of the project where they might find more information.

This is also a great opportunity to look at your project holistically and see where aspects aren't as smooth as you'd hope. Maybe if things were designed just slightly different the setup would be much easier & perhaps that could be worked into the next sprint?

## Summary

So theres oodles to be getting on with before the new starter joins. I really like the newbie checklist because it not only helps new starters but we can use it on the rest of the team to make sure they have everything too!

- An induction can make all the difference between a new hire hitting the ground running and not.
- Well planned inductions can make an organisation feel like a great place to work.
- They can be used as an opportunity for self reflection to see where improvements can be made.
- Our first task is to let them know what they'll be going to be working on and who they will be working with.
- Give them what they need from day one by making a newbie checklist of all the bibs and bobs the project has and running through it for each newbie that joins
- Write out an induction plan and lay it out in a spreadsheet
- Start small and general to begin with and get progressively more detailed
- Group items together to help the content flow logically
- Provide information just in time and avoid brain dumping.
- Walk through the plan with the rest of the team
- Keep an eye on your team wellbeing, if theres source of stress look to neutralise that by providing support.
- Write a clear readme that focuses on the most walked path.

We've got our plan now so we can be rest easy knowing we're prepared for their arrival. In the next part we'll go over their first day.

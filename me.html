<h1>Who's this Sucka?</h1>

<section>
		<h3>I'm Rob, an aspiring web developer &amp; designer from a little place called Peterborough in the UK.</h3>

		<p>Since 2007 I've been working with various clients to create fun and exciting websites that push the boundaries of the web.</p>

		<p>Although I prefer coding using front end languages such as html and css, I'm also fluent in server side languages and frameworks such as PHP, and the popular Wordpress platform.</p>

		<p>In my free time, when not working on personal projects, I can be found taking long scenic cycling tours across the country.</p>
